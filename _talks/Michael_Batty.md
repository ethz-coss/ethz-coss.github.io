Simulating the Future City - Where AI Meets Design

Although we find it impossible to predict the future city, we have the power to invent it. 
But whether we can invent a better future depends on the theories and tools that we have developed to simulate urban form and function, enmeshed within our own powers of creativity which are both explicit rational and intuitive. 
Most of our work on understanding the structure of cities does not explore their futures but at last, there is a sense that we are beginning to focus on how we might exploit our creativity using new digital tools based on collective AI and design methods. 
In this talk, I will review the turbulent history of AI which has attempted with little success so far to enable better design but also, I will identify new methods that appear much more promising in thinking how we explain the existing structure of cities using AI, particularly deep leaning, and translate these into methods for generating optimal future cities by manipulating their network architectures.
