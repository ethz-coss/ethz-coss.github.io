A Special Issue of 
<a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/"> EPJ Data Science </a> 
will feature work on the subject “Smarter Cities and Societies: What We Can and Cannot Optimize For”.

The submission deadline for invited manuscripts is 31st of July 2025. Earlier submissions are welcome.
We very much look forward to receiving your original manuscripts. While preparing
them, please consider the scope of the journal 
<a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/about"> (link) </a>
and the scope of our Special Issue <a href="https://link.springer.com/collections/gcjiahdghf"> (link) </a>.
 
Ideally, please also address the question <strong>„What we can and cannot optimize for“</strong>.
Besides a discussion of what <em><strong> can </strong></em> be done with data science approaches or computer
simulations, you are encouraged to address <em><strong> limitations </strong></em>, such as ethical or cultural issues, 
values, or qualities like human dignity. It could also mean that we need a multi-dimensional 
and co-evolutionary approach to promote thriving cities and societies - or anything else you 
might think of. For example, you may discuss limitations of a data science approach, 
of optimization, of computational possibilities, simulation or prediction attempts.

The link for submission is now available <a href="https://link.springer.com/collections/gcjiahdghf"> SUMBIT </a>
